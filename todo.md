# TODOs:
- [ ] The examples need to be updated. Especially on the main branch.
- [ ] Resolve the transpose issue in the model module and the mask module.
- [ ] Make the model use `batch_first` by default.
- [x] Refactor the RNNLoss part, let it take a dictionary instead of many separate `lambda_*` parameters. --> added the `CompositeLoss` instead.
- [x] Added batch_first parameter. Adjusted to batch_first by default to follow PyTorch standard.
- [x] Varying `alpha`. Alpha is now learnable
- [ ] Make `alpha` can be defined with a vector.
- [ ] Need to adjust implementation for `apply_plasticity` as it won't support SSL framework.
- [ ] Reconsider the `apply_plasticity`, Adam will not work with it.
- [ ] Change output to readout. (Forgot what I meant by this).
- [ ] Need some property functions to get the model parameters in a simpler way.
- [ ] Need some kind of function or managing class to perform the forward pass. Like `model({"area_1": input_1, "area_2": input_2})`.
- [ ] Remove the deprecation warnings.
- [ ] The `get_area` related of functions in the mask module are a bit un-intuitive. Might be good to rename them.
