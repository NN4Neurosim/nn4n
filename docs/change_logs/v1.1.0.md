## Verson 1.1.0 Change Logs

## TODOs
- [ ] Put initialization to structures, i.e., the distribution of weights, biases, etc.
- [ ] Add custom controls to the update speeds of different parts of the network.
- [ ] Remove `scaling` from `CTRNN`.
- [ ] Move `self_connections` to `structure` class.
- [ ] Remove `layer_biases`.
- [ ] Fix documentation for `print_layers`, add `plot_layers`.
- [ ] Let `structure` be a parameter of `CTRNN`.
- [ ] Rename and upgraded `learnable` to `plasticity_masks`. `plasticity_masks` inherits everything from `learnable`, but can also be masks that can be used to control the plasticity of every single weight in the network.
- [ ] Rename and upgraded `layer_distributions` to `weights`. `weights` inherits everything from `layer_distributions`, but can also be a list of weight matrices that used to directly initialize the weights of the network.
- [ ] Rename `layer_biases` to `biases`. `biases` inherits everything from `layer_biases`, but can also be a list of bias vectors that used to directly initialize the biases of the network.
- [ ] Rename `positivity_constraints` to `ei_masks`. `ei_masks` inherits everything from `positivity_constraints`, but can also be masks that can be used to control the positivity of every single weight in the network.
- [ ] Rename `sparsity_constraints` to `sparsity_masks`. `sparsity_masks` inherits everything from `sparsity_constraints`, but can also be masks that can be used to control the sparsity of every single weight in the network.
- [ ] Removed `layer_masks`. This is now split into `plasticity_masks`, `ei_masks`, and `sparsity_masks` to increase flexibility and reduce confusion.
- [ ] Removed `scaling`. This is now split into `weights` by manually scaling the weight matrices.
- [ ] Merged `input_dim`, `hidden_size`, and `output_dim` into `dims`.
