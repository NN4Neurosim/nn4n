nn4n.criterion
==================

The loss functions are powerful tools to simulate biological constraints that fall
outside the scope of the network architecture (e.g. firing rate, synaptic weight, etc).
The ``nn4n.criterion`` module provides a set of loss functions that are commonly used
in the scope of neuroscience modeling.
