# NeuroNN
Neural network has been increasingly used as a means to study both computational and theoretical neuroscience in recent years. We include some of the most commonly used the NN architectures in the research of neuroscience to ease the implementation process.

## Frameworks
### EIRNN
We implemented the Excitatory-Inhibitory constrainted RNN proposed in [Training Excitatory-Inhibitory Recurrent Neural Networks for Cognitive Tasks: A Simple and Flexible Framework](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004792) by Song et al. 2016.
